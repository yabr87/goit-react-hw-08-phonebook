### phonebook
https://yabr87.github.io/goit-react-hw-08-phonebook/

This is a web application built using the React framework and the Redux library
for state management.

The project's goals were:

- to learn how to work with the Redux library;
- to create functionality for user registration and login to work with personal
  data collections;
- to create a phone book that allows adding, deleting, and editing contacts.

The application's main page contains a form for adding new contacts. For each
contact, the user can specify a name and phone number. The list of all contacts
is displayed on the same page, below the add form.

The user can edit or delete any contact by clicking on the corresponding button
next to the contact information. There is also a feature to filter contacts by
name.

The application saves login data in the browser's local storage using the
Redux-persist library. This project is part of a React and Redux training
program and was created as part of a GoIT homework assignment.
